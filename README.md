# Spring boot Security oAuth (using Github)

Basic Spring boot Security OAuth (using Github). Angular code is not covered here, but the calls are mocked using Thunderclient requests (check 'Mock oAuth without UI').

## Overview of Components

- Spring boot Backend Service (uses Github OAuth)
  - TokenStore: Generate token from/for authentication.
  - TokenFilter: Filters and validates the Auth Bearer tokens coming in HTTP requests using JWT Hashmap cache.
  - SecurityConfig.successHandler: Generate the token using the TokenStore call and return the access token in the response to clients on auth success.
  - SecurityConfig.authenticationEntryPoint: Unauthenticated request will be shown 401 unauthorized error.
  - SecurityConfig.corsConfiguration: Allow XHR requests.
  - InMemoryRequestRepository: Use HashMap to hold the OAuthRequest in-memory temporarily while the request is begin processed by Github.
  - HomeController.username: Get the username.
- Angular Client (Mocked via Thunderclient)
  - Login Component: Show the login button.
  - Callback Component: Github redirects to this callback URL.
  - Home Component: Access post login.
  - AuthGaurd: Check if the user is authenticated or not. Unauthenticated users redirected to login.
  - Header Interceptor: Put Auth HTTP header in each request.

## Setup Github

- Go to Github > Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps
- Click on 'Register a new application'. 
  - Set homepage URL to http://localhost:4200
  - Set callback URL to http://localhost:4200/callback
- You will be provided Client ID and Client secrets.

## Application Properties

- Refer `application.properties` for `client-id`, `client-secret` and `redirectUri`. 
- The `client-id` and `client-secret` is generated when you onboard your application on Github (steps given above).
- `redirectUri` is the callback url of your Angular application where `code-id` and `state` will be sent by Github oAuth.

## SecurityConfig Class

- `config.SecurityConfig` class extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` and uses `@EnableWebSecurity`.
- Configuration allows access to oAuth and login URIs without the need of authentication. Any other request to the URIs should be authenticated.
- Upon success, the auth object (Github principals) will be saved in a HashMap cache along with the generated JWT token [key-value pairs]. JWT token is generated via `TokenStore` class. Unauthenticated request will be shown 401 unauthorized error.
- The authorization requests to Github are stored temporarily in-memory using HashMap by `config.InMemoryRequestRepository` class.

## Token Store Class

- As this is a Authorization server assisting Github (Resource Server), we can define our own custom method to generate the JWTs. This is covered under `config.TokenStore` class.
- `config.SecurityConfig.successHandler()` (When oAuth is successful) calls `config.TokenStore` to create custom token store (generates JWT and store it in Hashmap cache along with user's Github principals).

## Token Filter Class

- The `TokenFilter` class extends `OncePerRequestFilter`. 
- It checks the authorization token in the header of each HTTP request. 
- If the authorization token is found, it spilts the 'Bearer' part away.
- After this we check if the token is present in the Token Store (HashMap cache). 
- If yes, we place it inside the security context.

## InMemoryRequestRepository Class

- Holds the OAuth request temporarily in-memory while the Github request is being made.
- If the request contains 'state' parameter, the logic removes previous cached value from the in-memory cache and returns the removed cache value.
- On the other hand `saveAuthorizationRequest` saves the authorizationRequest in the cache.

# Overview of Token generation and Github Principals

```
OAuth2AuthenticationToken returned by Github after successful authorization includes many principals 
and user parameters but not the token. Token is generated by this Springboot service as we 
know that the oAuth is successful, we can create and provide our own token now to the UI.
NOTE: Refer HomeController to check the values returned by Github in OAuth2AuthenticationToken.
NOTE: In oAuth framework, Resource Server provides resources (user info, photos, etc) and Authorization 
Server manages tokens.
NOTE: Github is the Resource Server for user info. This Spring boot service is the Authorization 
Server which manages token inside HashMap cache.
```

- `TokenStore` class generates a JWT token using UUID and stores the Github principals corresponding to the generated JWT in a HashMap.

![HashMap Cache Sample](/src/main/resources/images/hashmap-jwt-cache.png "HashMap Cache Sample")

- `TokenFilter` extends `OncePerRequestFilter` and checks for JWT in HashMap cache in each request. 

## oAuth Flow

- The user visits the UI hosted on http://localhost:4200/home. [This project does not have the UI component]
- The UI > AuthGaurd checks if the user is authenticated. If yes he is redirected to http://localhost:4200/home.
- If the user is not authenticated, AuthGaurd redirects the user to our Spring boot service URL http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/github.
- http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/github builds the URL and further redirects the user to https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize.
- The user grants access to the user on Github.
- Github then redirects to the UI callback URL with the `state` and `code` parameters http://localhost:4200/callback?code=<YOUR_CODE>&state=<YOUR_STATE>
- UI further redirects the `state` and `code` parameters to our Spring boot service URL http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github?code=<YOUR_CODE>&state=<YOUR_STATE>
- Our Springboot service gets the user principals from Github and generates its own JWT token. This token is mapped to user principals and saved inside HashMap. The access token is then returned back to the UI.
  
```
{accessToken: "353f02d2-e804-49bf-8257-73af6bc1597e"}
```

- UI stores the custom JWT access token inside local storage on the client side. 
- UI header interceptor then places authorization bearer token in each server request to fetch user details.
- Spring boot service (TokenFilter) validates access token in the Hashmap and provides the relevant user data fetched from Github.

## Mock oAuth without UI

- Assume that you have not logged in on the UI. 
- In such case UI will redirect you from http://localhost:4200 to http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/github.
- First step is to open http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/github in your browser.
- Browser will redirect you to https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize for Authorization.
- After authorization, you will be redirected to callback URL http://localhost:4200/callback?code=<YOUR_CODE>&state=<YOUR_STATE>
- Second step is to copy the code and state parameters from the above callback URL and place them in this URL http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github?code=<YOUR_CODE>&state=<YOUR_STATE>
- Third step is to open this URL in a new browser tab. You will get back an access token.
- Fourth step is to place this access token under Header > Authorization of the Thunderclient request exported under resource folder.
- Send the request and you will get the username from our Authorization service.

## Scalability

- The HashMap cache contains key-value pairs of JWT token and Github User Principals. 
- As requests grow, key-value pairs for each token can be fetched easily.
- We can have many users, each of them will have their own Github User Principals inside this Spring boot service (Authorization server) and access token will be maintained by the UI inside the local storage by each user.
